based on linkyards [docker-atlassian-plugin-sdk](https://hub.docker.com/r/linkyard/docker-atlassian-plugin-sdk/)

Also have a look on the [corresponding Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/sknopp94/atlassdkwithfirefoxselenium) for this image.

# Plugin Preparation _(required!)_

Because Docker does not work performant enough on the root file system directly, this image needs to move the target directory to an internal path. (You'll find it in containers under `/tmp/target/`). After the build has finished the folder is copied into the usual `target`-folder for further investigations.

You need to add a property in your plugins `pom.xml` as follows so this image can work:

```xml
<project>
	<!-- ... -->
	<properties>
		<!-- ... -->
		<buildDirectory>${project.basedir}/target</buildDirectory>
	</properties>
	<!-- ... -->
	<build>
		<directory>${buildDirectory}</directory>
		<!-- ... -->
	</build>
</project>
```

# Usage

Switch into your project home directory and run the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -P --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/app --mount source=atlasmvncache,target=/root/.m2/repository sknopp94/atlassdkwithfirefoxselenium <maven-command>
```
**short explanation**
 * The containers can be used once only. So use the `--rm` flag! 
 * maybe we want to access our Atlassian instance, so we expose the therefore needed ports (`-P`) 
 * The first `--mount` is binding your project directory
 * The second `--mount` creates/binds the cache volume for maven repo files
 * `<maven-command>` could be set to `integration-test`, `package`, `run`, `debug` for example. \
The parameters are directly given to Atlassians `atlas-mvn` cli-tool ([see here for details](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/atlas-mvn/) and enjoy their documentation skills ðŸ˜‰).
